# To do list: Updated by 10th May.
Here is the conclusion after a week of struggling with React framework and revision.
- The ultimate solution is to fix the error anyway. If I really can't figure it out till 13 of May, then restart again.


# Problem
[ ] 1. Image of each card does not display at all. 
Advisory: trace the connected source of its image. URL might be broken. Otherwise, track it to URL on internet.
[ ] 2. About me need to have a proper box(card) for its dialogue explanation.
[ ] 3. The homepage must be redirected to its main page. Current destination is wrong.

# Extra:
- image folder is in src folder. Just do it. No need to put in public for now.
- After git init, seems all previous git commit have been lost. Well, keep doing this properly for this time. Keep in mind - git init may initialise all commit log too.

Previous note:
- video is not loading -> disabled it.
- image for cards does not load properly -> fixing in progress.
- maybe I should change the font for aboutme section?
